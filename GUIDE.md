## üìã **Video Structure & Timing**

### **1. Introduction & Problem Statement** (2 minutes)

#### **Opening Hook** (30 seconds)
- "Hi, I'm Amit Dubey, and I've just completed a challenging SCD abstraction implementation"
- "Today I'll walk you through how I transformed complex database operations into simple one-liners"
- "This project demonstrates advanced Django skills, database optimization, and system design thinking"

#### **Problem Explanation** (1.5 minutes)
**Show the SYSTEM_DESIGN.md file and explain:**

```markdown
"Let me show you the problem we're solving. In traditional SCD systems..."
```

**Key Points to Cover:**
- **What is SCD**: "SCD tracks data changes over time using versions"
- **Current Pain Points**: 
  - Complex queries requiring deep SCD expertise
  - Performance issues with millions of PaymentLineItem records
  - Code duplication across teams
  - Error-prone manual version management

**Screen Action**: Navigate to `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` and highlight the problem statement section

---

### **2. Solution Architecture Overview** (2.5 minutes)

#### **High-Level Architecture** (1 minute)
**Show the architecture diagram in SYSTEM_DESIGN.md:**

```markdown
"Here's my solution approach - a clean abstraction layer that hides all SCD complexity"
```

**Explain the layers:**
- **REST API Layer**: Simple endpoints for common operations
- **SCD Abstraction Layer**: The core innovation - transforms complex to simple
- **Django ORM Layer**: Optimized models with strategic indexing
- **SQLite Database**: Clean SCD data structure

#### **Key Innovation** (1.5 minutes)
**Show code comparison:**

```python
# Before (Complex - show this in your IDE)
latest_versions = Job.objects.annotate(
    max_version=Subquery(
        Job.objects.filter(id=OuterRef('id')).aggregate(
            Max('version')
        ).values('max_version')
    )
).filter(version=F('max_version'), company_id=company_id, status='active')

# After (Simple - show this)
active_jobs = get_latest_jobs(company_id=company_id, status='active')
```

**Key Message**: "I've reduced 15 lines of complex SCD logic into a simple one-liner"

---

### **3. Technical Implementation Deep Dive** (4 minutes)

#### **Core SCD Models** (1 minute)
**Navigate to `scd_app/models.py` and explain:**

```python
"Let me show you the foundation - my SCD model structure"
```

**Highlight in the code:**
- **SCDModelMixin**: Base class with `id`, `version`, `uid` pattern
- **Strategic indexing**: Show the `Meta` class with indexes
- **Business models**: Job, Timelog, PaymentLineItem extending SCD

**Key Point**: "Notice how I've made SCD complexity invisible to developers"

#### **SCD Abstraction Core** (2 minutes)
**Navigate to `scd_app/scd_manager.py` and showcase:**

```python
"This is the heart of my solution - the SCDAbstraction class"
```

**Walk through key methods:**
- **`get_latest_records()`**: "This automatically filters to latest versions"
- **`update_record()`**: "This automatically creates new versions"
- **`create_record()`**: "This handles initial SCD record creation"

**Performance Highlight**: Show the optimized query pattern in comments

#### **Query Optimization Strategy** (1 minute)
**Show the efficient latest version filtering:**

```sql
-- Show this SQL comment in your code
"Instead of N+1 queries, I use efficient subqueries with proper indexing"
```

**Key Technical Points:**
- Efficient subquery for latest versions
- Strategic database indexing
- Django QuerySet integration for memory efficiency

- "Consistent API pattern across all endpoints"

#### **Pattern 3: Payment Line Items** (45 seconds)
```bash
# Show this endpoint
http://localhost:8000/api/payments/contractor/cont_004/?days=30
```

**Explain:**
- "Gets latest payment line items for contractor in last 30 days"
- "Handles complex job UID relationships automatically"

#### **Pattern 4: Timelogs** (45 seconds)
```bash
# Show this endpoint
http://localhost:8000/api/timelogs/contractor/cont_004/?days=7
```

**Highlight:**
- "Time-based filtering with automatic latest version resolution"
- "All 4 required patterns working seamlessly"
